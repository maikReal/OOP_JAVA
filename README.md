# OOP_JAVA

Here you can find different tasks, which I've solved on Java <br>
The `baseExample` project include many modules with solved tasks. The number of modules will replenish. Every module include different java classes. Sometimes you can find javadoc for incomprehensible classes. <br>
`Modules:`
1. `homework_1` consist 4 tasks from `Yandex-Contest`
2. `homework_2` consist 3 tasks:
  -> Class with `geometrical distances` <br>
  -> Class with `VeryLong` integer <br>
  -> Class with algorithm of `Aho-Korasik` <br>
